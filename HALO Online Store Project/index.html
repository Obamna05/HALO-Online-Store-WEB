        <p id="featuredP">Promethean Knights are a class of mechanized Forerunner Promethean warriors created by the Ur-Didact toward the end of the Forerunner-Flood war to combat the Flood. After the Librarian exiled the Ur-Didact on Requiem, several legions of these constructs stationed on the shield world went dormant for the next 100,000 years. The machines—as well as their master—were reawakened in late 2557, when John-117 and the UNSC stumbled upon Requiem. By 2558, they, along several other Promethean constructs, had fallen under control of the Created, led by Cortana, who believed the artificial intelligences were the rightful heirs of the Mantle of Responsibility, not humanity.</p>
